# This workflow build and push a Docker container to Google Artifact Registry
# and deploy it on Cloud Run when a commit is pushed to the "main"
# branch.
#
# To configure this workflow:
#
# 1. Enable the following Google Cloud APIs:
#
#    - Artifact Registry (artifactregistry.googleapis.com)
#    - Cloud Run (run.googleapis.com)
#    - IAM Credentials API (iamcredentials.googleapis.com)
#
#    You can learn more about enabling APIs at
#    https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158841.
#
# 2. Create and configure a Workload Identity Provider for GitHub:
#    https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth#preferred-direct-workload-identity-federation.
#
#    Depending on how you authenticate, you will need to grant an IAM principal
#    permissions on Google Cloud:
#
#    - Artifact Registry Administrator (roles/artifactregistry.admin)
#    - Cloud Run Developer (roles/run.developer)
#
#    You can learn more about setting IAM permissions at
#    https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/manage-access-other-resources
#
# 3. Change the values in the "env" block to match your values.
